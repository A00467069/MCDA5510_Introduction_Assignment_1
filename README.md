#A00467069 - Jerry Caleb Jeabasingh

My name is Jerry Caleb and did my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at Karunya University. I worked in Valeo as a Simulation Engineer for 5 years. During my tenure there I did few scripting activities and eventually got to know about data analytics and ML. I started exploring that and did a project in our company. Slowly I developed interest in Machine Learning and wanted to learn more in detail and practically and so I opted for this course. I love to play mobile games like Call of Duty Mobile and Clash Royale and the love for gaming has united us all.

#TeamMate - 1 (Roy Jasper)

Roy Jasper did his undergraduate degree back in India in Information Technology and worked in LTIMindtree for 4 years as a data engineer. He was engaged in creating ETL pipelines in SQL Server Integration Services defining data streams to load data from multiple sources to multiple destinations and cleaning and tuning the data. And he also worked on creating, publishing Power BI reports according to the requirements of the stakeholders which will make them to take predictive business decisions. The prime reason for him to take this course is to elevate his data engineering skills and to be a data scientist.
